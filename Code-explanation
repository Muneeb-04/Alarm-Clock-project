In this piece of code, I made a simple alarm clock which would activate an audible tone after the countdown. First I created a function called 'alarm', which created a countdown timer that takes the duration in seconds. It then uses a 'while' loop to update the countdown every second, showing the remaining time on the screen. To get the countdown on the screen to display properly, I used the '02d' function to keep the numbers to 2 digits. Once the countdown ends, it plays an alarm sound from the "alarm.mp3" file. The main part of the code prompts the user for the desired countdown duration in minutes and seconds. To do this, I used the 'input' function which has the integer ('int') function before it to convert the input to numbers. It then converts the input to total seconds using an arithmetic operation, and calls the 'alarm' function to start the countdown and trigger the audible alarm. Finally, I added a 'CLEAR_AND_RETURN' function to make the countodwon appear on a single line rather than a list format.
